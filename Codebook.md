Experimental design as stated in the documentation from the above source
(README.txt) involved the following:

-   The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within
    an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities
    (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
    wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.

-   Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear
    acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz.

-   The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.

-   The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70%
    of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the
    test data.

-   The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by
    applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of
    2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window).

-   The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion
    components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body
    acceleration and gravity.

-   The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components,
    therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window,
    a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and
    frequency domain.

-   See 'features_info.txt' for more details (available as part of original data
    set)

*Raw Data*

As stated in the original data set documentation (available at web site
specified above in ‘README.txt’ and ‘features_info.txt’ files) the complete raw
data set consisted 180 records (30 subjects with each of 6 activities) with:

-   An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment

-   Activity label for the type of activity carried out by the subject

-   561 measure variables consisting of 17 statistical measures for each of 33
    variables

For this analysis, a subset of the raw data has been extracted which takes only
the mean (mean()) and standard deviation (std()) statistical measure for each of
the 33 variables for both the test set and trial sets of data. (NB: mean
frequency (meanFreq()) data has been excluded in this analysis as it has been
assumed to be a distinct statistical measure to mean()). Data from the ‘train’
and ‘test’ data sub-sets has been combined together to obtain an ‘all subject’
data set for the extracted variables.

This data was sourced from the falling original files in the data set:

| **Filename**        | Data                                                                    |

*Processed Data*

Two processed data tables have been generated:

1.  A tidy data set consisting of the 66 measurement variables (33 means and 33
    standard deviations) made for each of the 10,299 measurement records
    contained within the combined raw data ‘test’ and ‘train’ data sets

    -   See output file ‘Data_Extract.csv” generated by ‘run_analysis.R’ script

2.  A tidy data set containing the average of each of the 66 measurement
    variables for each the 30 subjects for each of the 6 activities carried out
    by subject on “wide, tidy data set”, i.e. 180 records (6 activities for each
    of 30 subjects) with 66 measurement variables and two ID variables in each
    record)

    -   Each measurement variable was grouped by ‘subject’ and by ‘activity’ and
        the average for each measurement variable calculated under this grouping
        of records

    -   See output file ‘Assignment_Output.csv” generated by ‘run_analysis.R’
        script

The output Variables (from ‘run_analysis.R’ script) are:

| **Variable**                    | **Type**              | **Potential Values**                                              | **Source**                                                         |
